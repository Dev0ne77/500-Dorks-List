# Dork-Pack

A curated pack of search dorks and query strings for reconnaissance and SQL injection discovery.

## Overview

Dork-Pack provides a structured collection of dorks and query patterns used for reconnaissance, exposure footprinting, and SQL injection target discovery.  
Designed for offensive security, manual research, OSINT workflows, and automation pipelines.

## Features

- Curated search dorks (Google, Bing, Yandex, etc.)
- SQL injection discovery dorks
- Exposure mapping and indexing filters
- Consistent categorization for dataset reuse
- Suitable for manual recon or tool integration

## Structure


> `dorks/` → general-purpose dorks  
> `dorks-sqli/` → SQL injection‑focused dorks  
> `dorks-exposure/` → indexing/leak/fingerprint dorks  
> `docs/` → notes, research, methodology  
> `scripts/` → optional automation helpers

## Usage

Dorks can be used manually via search engines or integrated into scanning and filtering tools.

Example (manual):
- Copy query → run in preferred search engine

Example (automation idea):
- Use lists as input for recon workflows or scanners

## Intended Use

- Offensive security labs
- Pentesting workflows
- Recon/research environments
- OSINT methodologies
- Data catalog for scanner development

## Contributions

PRs welcome for new dorks, structured datasets, categorization improvements, or better filtering logic.
